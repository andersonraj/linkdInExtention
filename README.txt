Project Overview:

The LinkedIn Info Scraper is a Chrome extension designed to scrape profile information from LinkedIn. While the extension pack has been created, it is currently not fully functional. Additional steps are required to enable complete scraping functionality. This README outlines the current status and steps to load and test the extension.


Current Status:

- Extension Pack Created: The basic framework for the extension has been developed, but it is not yet fully operational for scraping LinkedIn profile data.
- Functionality: At this point, the extension adds an "Add to AirTable" button on LinkedIn pages, but further work is needed for complete functionality.


Steps to Load and Test the Extension:

1. Extract the Extension Files:
   - Right-click on the `LinkedInExtension.zip` file and select "Extract All" to unzip the contents.
   
2. Open Google Chrome:
   - Launch Chrome and click on the Extensions icon in the top-right corner of the browser toolbar.
   
3. Enable Developer Mode:
   - Inside the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" option in the top-right corner.
   
4. Load the Unpacked Extension:
   - Click on the "Load Unpacked" button.
   - Select the folder where the extracted extension files are located (`LinkedInExtension`).
   
5. Verify Extension Installation:
   - You should now see the LinkedIn Info Scraper listed in your extensions page.
   
6. Test the Extension:
   - Open a LinkedIn profile page.
   - You should see an "Add to AirTable" button, which is part of the scraping functionality currently under development.
